# Person-reID
ISSUM person-reID project
This project is focused on the unsupervised person-reid that is applicable to different domains.
## GAN-based Unsupervised Person-reid
explain the method here


## steps:
### Prepare datasets
Prepare the datasets to the common format,for training and test procedures (taken from st-reid Github)
prepare.py 
### train the person re-id model
### extract features via pre-trained model
### extrcat hard negative samples
### train GAN for negative samples
### extract time lift distribution
### evaluate the results
### re-rank the results
